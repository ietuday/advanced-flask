<p>Welcome to the course once again!</p><p>In order to get up to speed, in this section we'll be looking at a basic REST API. It's something we learned about in the introductory course, but I appreciate you may not have taken that course!</p><p>To help you with this section, we've written an e-book. You can read it, reference it, or treat it as an extra way to understand the starting code and what goes on in our first REST API.</p><p><a href="https://arac.tecladocode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Access the e-book here</a>.</p><p>Together with the videos, it should be plenty to get you acquainted with REST APIs with Flask and Python!</p><p>As always, if you have any questions, fire away in the Course Q&amp;A or the Slack channel (which you can join by clicking this link: <a href="http://slack.tecla.do" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://slack.tecla.do</a>)</p>
